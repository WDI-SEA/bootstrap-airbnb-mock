# Airbnb Mock with Boostrap 4.0

We last built an Airbnb Mock using vanilla CSS and HTML. In this lab you will be using a CSS framework/library known as Bootstrap (in this case we will be using version 4.0) to build out the same Airbnb mock, but this time using the grid layout that Bootstrap 4 is built upon. 


### Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your local computer. *You will not need to turn this in (no pull request).*
* A HTML file (`index.html`) and CSS file (`css/style.css`) have been created for you. Content is also provided in a folder called `img` (just like your original Airbnb mock). 
* Use these existing files and the Bootstrap v4 library to build out a mockup of the original Airbnb website as seen in the `solution.jpg` file in this repo.

Link to Bootstrap V4 docs for reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/

## Added Challenge
If you have experience with Bootstrap and won't find praciticing via a lab helpful, other recommended activities:
  - Look at the new code/features in Bootstrap v5 (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
  - Checkout a new CSS or design framework. Tailwind.css is a popular framework which allows for more class based styling (docs here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs). 
  - Try to style the current Airbnb website design in Bootstrap 4 (www.airbnb.com).
